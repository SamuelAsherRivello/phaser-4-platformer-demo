# Phaser 4 Platformer

This small Phaser 4 browser demo keeps its surrounding interface in HTML while the game layer renders a movable square and its clickable controls.

3. Push to `main` to deploy through the GitHub Pages workflow.
4. Run the **Release** workflow from GitHub Actions to bump the patch version, tag it, and create the GitHub release.

### 🛠 Edit Level Design

See [Edit Level Design](docs/edit-level-design.md) for the Tiled level-update
workflow and FoozleLab Structure Terrain instructions.

## Rendering and Tiled Level

- The demo requires **WebGL**. Phaser's SpriteGPULayer and TilemapGPULayer are
  WebGL GPU-batching features; this project does not claim WebGPU rendering or
  provide a Canvas fallback.
- The world uses 32 by 32 source-pixel tiles at native 100 percent presentation.
  Level 1 is 81 columns by 51 rows (2,592 by 1,632 source pixels).

## Project Details

- `phaser4-platformer/src/main.js` contains the WebGL Phaser scene, Tiled map loading, GPU layers, physics, and game-layer controls.
- `phaser4-platformer/index.html` provides the separate HTML UI layer and starts the Phaser module.
- [Phaser 4](https://phaser.io/download/phaser4) supplies the browser game engine.
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) provides local development and production builds.
