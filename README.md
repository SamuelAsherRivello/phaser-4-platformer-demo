# Phaser 4 Platformer

This small Phaser 4 browser demo keeps its surrounding interface in HTML while the game layer renders a movable square and its clickable controls.

## Getting Started

<!-- AI: Update these baseline Node/npm/Vite commands if the selected stack changes. -->
The project requires Node.js 24 and npm.

### 🛠 Build Project

1. From the repository root, run `npm install`.
2. Run `npm run build`.

### 🛠 Run Project

1. From the repository root, run `npm run dev` and open the localhost URL Vite prints.
2. Run `npm test` to execute the focused source checks.

### 🛠 Release Version

1. Run `npm test` and `npm run build` from the repository root.
2. Push to `main` to deploy through the GitHub Pages workflow.
3. Run the **Release** workflow from GitHub Actions to bump the patch version, tag it, and create the GitHub release.

## Controls

- Move the blue square left and right with A/D or the Left/Right arrow keys.
- Use the blue move joystick along the lower-left edge for horizontal touch movement. Up and down have no gameplay action yet.
- Trigger Action 1 with C or its gray Action 1 (C) button to jump while standing on a platform.
- Trigger Action 2 with V or its red Action 2 (V) button to make the square flicker.

## Rendering and Tiled Level

- The demo requires **WebGL**. Phaser's SpriteGPULayer and TilemapGPULayer are
  WebGL GPU-batching features; this project does not claim WebGPU rendering or
  provide a Canvas fallback.
- The game runs at a 320 by 180 logical resolution with 32 by 32 source-pixel
  tiles. At the 1280 by 720 target resolution, Phaser FIT-scales the scene by
  exactly 4x, so a tile displays at 128 by 128 pixels. Other display sizes use
  FIT scaling without changing the Tiled or physics measurements.
- Open
  [treasure-hunters-level.tmj](phaser4-platformer/assets/tiled/treasure-hunters-level.tmj)
  in Tiled to edit the level. It uses external tilesets in
  phaser4-platformer/assets/tiled/tilesets/ and has exactly Background and
  Foreground layers.
- The runtime loads
  [treasure-hunters-level.json](phaser4-platformer/assets/maps/treasure-hunters-level.json),
  an embedded-tileset export for Phaser. After editing the TMJ in Tiled, export
  the matching embedded JSON to this runtime path, then restart the dev server
  or hard-refresh the browser.

## Project Details

- `phaser4-platformer/src/main.js` contains the WebGL Phaser scene, Tiled map loading, GPU layers, physics, and game-layer controls.
- `phaser4-platformer/index.html` provides the separate HTML UI layer and starts the Phaser module.
- [Phaser 4](https://phaser.io/download/phaser4) supplies the browser game engine.
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) provides local development and production builds.
